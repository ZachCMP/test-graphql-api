### Running things

You'll need to run both the backend and frontend at the same time.  Backend is a Node.JS server using Apollo Server.  Frontend is a CRA build.

#### Run Frontend

```bash
cd cra1
yarn start
```

#### Run Backend

```bash
node index.js
# Or, if you have nodemon
nodemon index.js
```
